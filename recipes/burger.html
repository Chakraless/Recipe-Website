    <h1>Burgers</h1>
    <h4>Intro</h4>
    <p>
      Burgers are a popular and iconic dish in the realm of fast food and casual
      dining. They typically consist of a seasoned ground meat patty, often
      beef, though variations may include chicken, turkey, pork, or plant-based
      substitutes like black bean or lentil patties. The patty is usually
      grilled, fried, or charbroiled to achieve a crispy exterior and juicy
      interior. It's then placed between two halves of a soft bun, which can be
      toasted or plain, and accompanied by various toppings and condiments.
      Traditional toppings might include lettuce, tomato, onion, pickles, and
      cheese, while condiments such as ketchup, mustard, mayonnaise, and special
      sauces enhance the flavor profile. Additional ingredients like bacon,
      avocado, mushrooms, fried eggs, or jalape√±os can be added to create unique
      and indulgent variations. Burgers are often served with a side of fries,
      onion rings, or a side salad, and they're enjoyed in a wide range of
      settings, from fast-food joints to upscale restaurants. They're celebrated
      for their versatility, satisfying flavor, and the endless possibilities
      for customization to suit individual tastes. Whether enjoyed as a quick
      meal on the go or savored as a sit-down dining experience, burgers remain
      a beloved classic in culinary culture worldwide.
