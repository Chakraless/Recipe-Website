      <h1>Burgers</h1>
      <h4>Intro</h4>
      <p>
        Burgers are a popular and iconic dish in the realm of fast food and
        casual dining. They typically consist of a seasoned ground meat patty,
        often beef, though variations may include chicken, turkey, pork, or
        plant-based substitutes like black bean or lentil patties. The patty is
        usually grilled, fried, or charbroiled to achieve a crispy exterior and
        juicy interior. It's then placed between two halves of a soft bun, which
        can be toasted or plain, and accompanied by various toppings and
        condiments. Traditional toppings might include lettuce, tomato, onion,
        pickles, and cheese, while condiments such as ketchup, mustard,
        mayonnaise, and special sauces enhance the flavor profile. Additional
        ingredients like bacon, avocado, mushrooms, fried eggs, or jalapeños can
        be added to create unique and indulgent variations. Burgers are often
        served with a side of fries, onion rings, or a side salad, and they're
        enjoyed in a wide range of settings, from fast-food joints to upscale
        restaurants. They're celebrated for their versatility, satisfying
        flavor, and the endless possibilities for customization to suit
        individual tastes. Whether enjoyed as a quick meal on the go or savored
        as a sit-down dining experience, burgers remain a beloved classic in
        culinary culture worldwide.
