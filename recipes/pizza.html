      <h1>Pizza</h1>
      <h4>Introduction</h4>
      <p>
        Pizza is a popular and iconic dish in the realm of fast food and
        casual dining. It typically consists of a round, flattened base of
        dough topped with seasoned tomato sauce, cheese, and various toppings.
        These toppings can range from meats like pepperoni, sausage, or bacon to
        vegetables like mushrooms, onions, or peppers. Additional ingredients
        such as olives, pineapple, or even anchovies may also be added for
        flavor. The pizza is then baked in an oven until the crust is crispy
        and the cheese is melted and bubbly. Variations of pizza exist around
        the world, with different regions having their own unique styles and
        flavor profiles. Whether enjoyed as a quick meal on the go or savored
        as a sit-down dining experience, pizza remains a beloved classic in
        culinary culture worldwide.
