      <h1>Wings</h1>
      <p>
        Wings are a popular dish known for their flavorful and crispy texture.
        Typically made from chicken wings, they are seasoned, deep-fried, and
        then coated in various sauces, such as buffalo, barbecue, or teriyaki.
        They are often served with celery sticks and ranch or blue cheese
        dressing for dipping. Wings are a favorite appetizer or snack, enjoyed
        at parties, sports events, or as a main course at restaurants. Their
        versatility and delicious taste make them a beloved choice for many
        occasions.
